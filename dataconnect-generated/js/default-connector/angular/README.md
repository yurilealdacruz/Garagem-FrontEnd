# Generated Angular README
This README will guide you through the process of using the generated Angular SDK package for the connector `default`. It will also provide examples on how to use your generated SDK to call your Data Connect queries and mutations.

***NOTE:** This README is generated alongside the generated SDK. If you make changes to this file, they will be overwritten when the SDK is regenerated.*

You can use this generated SDK by importing from the package `@firebasegen/default-connector/angular` as shown below. Both CommonJS and ESM imports are supported.

You can also follow the instructions from the [Data Connect documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/data-connect/web-sdk#angular).

# TanStack Query Firebase & TanStack Angular Query
This SDK provides [Angular](https://angular.dev/) injectors generated specific to your application, for the operations found in the connector `default`. These injectors are generated using [TanStack Query Firebase](https://react-query-firebase.invertase.dev/) by our partners at Invertase, a library built on top of [TanStack Angular Query v5](https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/framework/angular/overview) and [AngularFire](https://github.com/angular/angularfire/tree/main).

***You do not need to be familiar with Tanstack Query or Tanstack Query Firebase to use this SDK.*** However, you may find it useful to learn more about them, as they will empower you as a user of this Generated Angular SDK.

## Installing TanStack Query Firebase and TanStack Angular Query Packages
In order to use the Angular generated SDK, you must install `AngularFire` and select `Data Connect` during the setup.

You can install `AngularFire` using the [Angular CLI](https://angular.dev/installation#install-angular-cli). You can also follow the installation instructions from the [TanStack Query Firebase documentation](https://react-query-firebase.invertase.dev/angular#automatic-setup).

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
```bash
ng add @angular/fire
# select Data Connect during setup!
```

This should handle configuring your project to use TanStack Query. However, if you need to set up manually, please follow the [TanStack Query Firebase documentation](https://invertase.docs.page/tanstack-query-firebase/angular#usage).

# Accessing the connector
A connector is a collection of Queries and Mutations. One SDK is generated for each connector - this SDK is generated for the connector `default`.

You can find more information about connectors in the [Data Connect documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/data-connect#how-does).

```javascript
import { getDataConnect } from 'firebase/data-connect';
import { connectorConfig } from '@firebasegen/default-connector';

const dataConnect = getDataConnect(connectorConfig);
```

## Connecting to the local Emulator
By default, the connector will connect to the production service.

To connect to the emulator, edit your `main.ts` file and your `app/app.config.ts` file and update your `provideDataConnect` provider:
You can also follow the emulator instructions from the [Data Connect documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/data-connect/web-sdk#emulator-react-angular).

```javascript
... // other imports
// update your imports to include the function that connects to the emulator
import { getDataConnect, provideDataConnect, connectDataConnectEmulator } from '@angular/fire/data-connect';

// update the `provideDataConnect` provider to provide an instance of `DataConnect` which uses the emulator:
export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    ... // other providers
    // Firebase Data Connect providers
    ...
    provideDataConnect(() => {
      const dataConnect = getDataConnect(connectorConfig);
      connectDataConnectEmulator(dataConnect, 'localhost', 9399);
      return dataConnect;
    }),
  ],
};
```

After it's initialized, you can call your Data Connect [queries](#queries) and [mutations](#mutations) using the injectors provided from your generated Angular SDK.

# Queries

No Queries were generated for the `default` connector.

If you want to learn more about how to use queries in Data Connect, you can follow the examples from the [Data Connect documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/data-connect/web-sdk#operations-react-angular).

# Mutations

No Mutations were generated for the `default` connector.

If you want to learn more about how to use Mutations in Data Connect, you can follow the examples from the [Data Connect documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/data-connect/web-sdk#operations-react-angular).
